```assembly
mov eax, [ebx+4]
add eax, 1
mov [ebx+4], eax
```
This code snippet has a potential issue related to memory access. If the memory location pointed to by `ebx+4` is not writable or if there are insufficient permissions, the instruction `mov [ebx+4], eax` will likely cause a segmentation fault or similar error.  Additionally, if `ebx` is not properly initialized, this will result in unexpected behavior.
